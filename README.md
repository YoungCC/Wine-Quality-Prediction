# Wine_Quality_Prediction

This project aims to predict the quality ratings from various physicochemical properties of red and white wines. Due to the red wine dataset contains less observations, several machine learning methods were mainly applied to model the white wine dataset under regression and classification approaches. In order to get better performance of a data science model, the original dataset was splitted into two parts: training data and test data. It is found that the response (quality) is associated with most of predictors provided in this dataset. The random forest model shows the best performance in regression.
